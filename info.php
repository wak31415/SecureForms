        <b>WARNING:</b><br>SecureForms is still under heavy development. It is possible that
        user accounts and encrypted user data is deleted in our process of contributing
        to a more secure internet. Please do not use this for production purposes!
        It is currently only suited for testing.

        and an appropriate license is found. It might still take 1-2 months before the

                    hacked our server! Your data is safe with us.

                    need to know what encryption means to use this application, it works 
                    just like any other Survey tool you know.
